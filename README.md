# Steph's Pre-work Study Guide

## Description

I created this webpage as a tool to organize information for Coding Boot Camp. 
It contains my notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
The page provides the user with one space to reference all four topics throughout the course. 
Creating this teaches the basics of writing HTML, as well as how to create a CSS and linking it to HTML code. 
I was able to practice making changes/commits on the page in different versions/branches, which I eventually merged with the main branch, including a few entry-level JavaScript codes.
